Hereâ€™s a simplified explanation of the workflow:

1. **Login**: User logs in with Google; an email is sent confirming the login.  
2. **Create Request**: The user creates a request with a title, description, type, urgency, and superior's email. Email notifications are sent to both the requester and the superior.  
3. **Logout**: User logs out; an email is sent confirming the logout.  
4. **Manager Login**: Superior logs in with Google; an email is sent confirming the login.  
5. **Approve Request**: Superior approves the request; an email is sent to both the requester and the superior with the approval status.  
6. **Manager Logout**: Superior logs out; an email is sent confirming the logout.  
7. **Requester Login**: Requester logs back in; an email is sent confirming the login.  
8. **View Status**: Requester views the approved/rejected status of their request.
